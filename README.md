# OpenDrinks

The computer-friendly database for all your favorite drinks! This project serves
to make it easy to allow computers to pour our cocktails for us, specifically
by only including the data they need in order to do so. This data is not so
great for a recipe book, but a Raspberry Pi will love it!

This repository serves as the primary data source for the Bartender project!

## Getting Started

On it's own, this repository doesn't do much. In order to make use of the
recipes listed here, check out the Bartender project.

In order to add new drinks to the database, you'll need `python3` and a copy
of your drink recipe with the units in milliliters.

## Development

In order to add a new drink to this repo, run `python3 drink_maker.py` from
your command line. This should walk you through all the steps to create a
recipe for your new drink, as well as records for each ingredient we don't
already know about.

Don't forget to add an image for your drink!

## Contributing

to the repo.
